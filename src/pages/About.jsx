            <h1>Our vision</h1>
            <p>This project started with a simple idea:</p>
            <blockquote>
                "As a player, I want to play a game of Gomoku so that I can win, lose or draw."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                That's it. Just a classic five-in-a-row game, brought online so we can challenge each other and have some fun.
            </p>
